# Online Voting System: Comprehensive Project Guide

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of the project's architecture, file naming conventions, and the logic within each module.

---

## 1. Project Overview
The **Online Voting System** is a full-stack application built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
- **Backend**: Handles API requests, database interactions, and security.
- **Frontend**: Provides a modern, responsive user interface for voting and administration.

---

## 2. File Naming Conventions

Consistency is key to a clean codebase. We follow these specific naming patterns:

### Backend
- **Controllers & Routes**: `camelCase.js` (e.g., [authController.js](file:///Users/pranavvishwakarma/Desktop/voting_system/backend/src/controllers/authController.js), [authRoutes.js](file:///Users/pranavvishwakarma/Desktop/voting_system/backend/src/routes/authRoutes.js))
- **Models**: `PascalCase.js` (e.g., [User.js](file:///Users/pranavvishwakarma/Desktop/voting_system/backend/src/models/User.js))
- **Configs/Utils**: `camelCase.js` (e.g., `db.js`, `generateToken.js`)

### Frontend
- **Components & Pages**: `PascalCase.jsx` (e.g., [Dashboard.jsx](file:///Users/pranavvishwakarma/Desktop/voting_system/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx))
- **Styles**: `PascalCase.css` (matching its component, e.g., [Dashboard.css](file:///Users/pranavvishwakarma/Desktop/voting_system/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.css))
- **Context/Hooks**: `PascalCase.jsx` for Context, `camelCase.js` for Hooks.

## 3. Folder Structure Breakdown

### Backend (`/backend/src`)
| Folder | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `config/` | Database and environment configurations. |
| `controllers/` | Contains the logic for processing requests (The "Brain"). |
| `models/` | Defines the structure of data in MongoDB (The "Skeleton"). |
| `routes/` | Maps URLs to specific controller functions. |
| `middleware/` | Code that runs before the controller (e.g., Auth checks). |
| `utils/` | Shared helper functions (e.g., JWT generation). |

### Frontend (`/frontend/src`)
| Folder | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `assets/` | Static files like images and icons. |
| `components/` | Small, reusable UI parts like `Navbar` or `Buttons`. |
| `context/` | Global state (e.g., `AuthContext` to know who is logged in). |
| `pages/` | Entire screen views like `Login`, `Dashboard`, and `Voting`. |

## 4. Understanding the Content

### A. The Backend Entry: `server.js`
[server.js](file:///Users/pranavvishwakarma/Desktop/voting_system/backend/server.js) is the starting point. It initializes Express, connects to MongoDB, and registers all API routes.
> [!NOTE]
> All API routes are prefixed with `/api` (e.g., `/api/auth/login`).

### B. Data Models (The "What")
Files like [User.js](file:///Users/pranavvishwakarma/Desktop/voting_system/backend/src/models/User.js) define what a "User" looks like (name, email, encrypted password).
- We use **Mongoose** to interact with MongoDB.
- We use **Bcrypt** for password hashing to ensure security.

### C. Controllers (The "How")
[authController.js](file:///Users/pranavvishwakarma/Desktop/voting_system/backend/src/controllers/authController.js) contains functions like `registerUser` and `authUser`.
- It takes data from `req.body`.
- It interacts with the `Model` to find or save data.
- It returns a JSON response to the Frontend.

### D. Frontend Navigation: `App.jsx`
[App.jsx](file:///Users/pranavvishwakarma/Desktop/voting_system/frontend/src/App.jsx) is the router. It defines which component to show based on the URL.
- We use `ProtectedRoute` to ensure only logged-in users can see the `Dashboard`.

## 5. Typical Data Flow
1. **Frontend**: User clicks "Login" on `Login.jsx`.
2. **Frontend**: `fetch('/api/auth/login', { body: ... })` is called.
3. **Backend Route**: `authRoutes.js` receives the POST request and passes it to `authController.authUser`.
4. **Backend Controller**: Finds the user in MongoDB using [User.js](file:///Users/pranavvishwakarma/Desktop/voting_system/backend/src/models/User.js).
5. **Backend Controller**: Verifies password and returns a JWT (token).
6. **Frontend**: Receives the token, saves it in `AuthContext`, and redirects to `/dashboard`.

> [!TIP]
> Always check [package.json](file:///Users/pranavvishwakarma/Desktop/voting_system/backend/package.json) to see the list of dependencies and scripts like `npm start`.
